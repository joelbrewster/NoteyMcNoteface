#### Ruberic
Your app must:
* Create at least 5 RESTful routes with POST, PUT, GET and DELETE verbs using a ruby routing library (Using Sinatra or Rails).
* Use an ORM (default: active_record) to create a database table structure and interact with data using ruby
* Have some form of login for the user
* Properly manage packages using gems
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
* Be deployed to the public (default: Heroku)
